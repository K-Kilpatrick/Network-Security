Dear, Kelly!

Congratulations on your exceptional performance in completing the homework assignment! Your investigative skills in networking tasks are commendable.

Your thorough review of security and intrusion questions showcases a deep understanding of the subject. Your ability to analyze Snort rules and create your own demonstrates excellence.
Your work on the Drop Zone lab is excellent. You've executed tasks with precision, demonstrating proficiency in configuring zones and implementing rules.
In part 3, your answers regarding IDS vs IPS systems were excellent. However, you may need to revise defense and firewall architecture methodologies, as there seems to be some mixing up of the answers.

Overall, your dedication and understanding are impressive. Keep up the outstanding work!

Warm regards,
